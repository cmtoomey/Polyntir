I’m going to leave the features of the dashboard to the end. Next up - the wrapper. 
It’s all built using Google Polymer. What is Google Polymer? I’ll let them tell you all about it. 
The short version is that it’s basically a way to template the web - build, skin, and share core components. It’s responsive by design, integrates with Google’s Material Design principles, and drastically simplifies the process of web design. 
All I had to do was pick the parts I needed - header, toolbar, cards and start nesting them together. To make them float, it’s just a <paper-material elevation=“5″></paper-material> tag, and voila! floating pages.
Even better, because you get all the core HTML, styling and animation components out of the box, you can inspect the underlying code and demos, and just copy/paste their defaults into your project. It’s like a massive debugging tool at your fingertips - for someone who is constantly confused by CSS rules, it’s wonderful to see things in action and just apply those same principles to my own work.
Beyond ease of use - here’s why I chose Polymer. It assumes that certain aspects of the web should be a default: things like native responsiveness, data-binding, integration with Googles’s core services, e-commerce integration, offline, and push messaging should be deployable out of the gate.
